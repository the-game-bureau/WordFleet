## RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

### Introduction

*Word Fleet* combines the strategy of _Battleship®_ with the linguistic challenge of _Wordle®_.

### Mission Specs

| Personnel | Minimum Age | Mission Duration |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| 2 Captains | 10 | 15–30 minutes |

---

### Requisition

- 2 Battle Tracker sheets from [the-game-bureau.github.io/WordFleet](https://the-game-bureau.github.io/WordFleet)
- 2 pens or pencils
- 2 highlighters (optional)

---

### Fleet Deployment

Each captain deploys five Word-Ships on their Defense Grid. Use either auto-generated or custom words; both players must use the same method.

| Word-Ship Class | Length     | Example Name |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| KETCH           | 5 letters  | PIANO        |
| SHIP            | 4 letters  | JUMP         |
| SUB             | 3 letters  | BED          |
| ARK             | 3 letters  | RUN          |
| PT              | 2 letters  | IF           |

> **Note:** Word-Ship class names are for reference only and do not affect gameplay.

- Place Word-Ships left-to-right (horizontal) or top-to-bottom (vertical) only
- No diagonals, backwards, or upward placements
- Ships may touch but not overlap
- Use the same language for all ships
- No proper nouns, abbreviations, or suffixes

**Defense Manifest**: Record letter totals from all ships to help track what's been revealed.

### 📡 Hailing the Enemy 📡  
*A Mini-Game to Determine First Strike*

Each Captain has 5 secret Launch Codes (000–999). Use them to bluff your way to firing first!

#### How It Works

1. **Opening Hail** – One Captain calls out any 3-digit code.
2. **Response** – The opponent must choose:
   - **Concede** – Caller fires first.
   - **Challenge** – Caller reveals codes:
     - Code is valid → Caller fires first.
     - Code is fake → Challenger fires first.
   - **Counter** – Call a higher or equal code and become the new caller.
3. **Continue** – Players alternate turns until one concedes or is caught bluffing.

#### Example

> Captain A: “850” → Captain B: “900” → Captain A: “Challenge!”  
> Captain B reveals no 900 → Captain A fires first.

#### Key Rules

- Both players can have the same code
- Equal codes are valid counters
- Players must alternate — no countering your own counter

### 🎯 Engage the Enemy  
*Unleash Your Word Power!*

#### Step 1: Initial Strike

Choose a coordinate and call it out:
> “Fire on coordinate Echo-Seven!” or “E-7!”

Responses:

- **MISS** – No ship. Mark it with a dot. Turn ends.
- **HIT** – Ship confirmed. Proceed to Letter Strike.

#### Step 2: Letter Strike

Guess the letter at the coordinate:
> “S”

Responses:

- **BULLSEYE** – Correct letter at that position. Write it in. Turn ends.
- **TALLY** – Wrong letter. Defender announces how many total times that letter appears in their fleet. Turn ends.

#### Defender's Duty

Track incoming fire and update your Defense Manifest with every revealed letter.

---

### 🎖 Victory

Destroy all five enemy Word-Ships to win the game.

---

### ⚡ Advanced Protocols

#### Sinking Enemy Vessels

When all letters of a Word-Ship are revealed:

> “You sank my [WORD]!”

#### Vessel Destruction Protocol

Instead of firing normally, you may guess the full word.

- ✅ Correct: Instantly destroy the ship.
- ❌ Incorrect: Turn ends. You may not guess that word again.
