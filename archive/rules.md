**Players:** 2 | **Ages:** 10+ | **Game Time:** 15-30 minutes

## Rules of Engagement
Word Fleet combines the strategy of Battleship¬Æ with the word-building challenge of Wordle¬Æ.

## All Hands On Deck!

### Your Arsenal
- 2 Battle Tracker sheets from thegamebureau.com/wrdflt
- 2 pens or pencils
- 2 highlighters (optional) for enhanced tracking

### Deploy Your Fleet
Choose auto-generated or player-chosen Word Ships. Both captains must choose the same type. Place 5 Word Ships on your Battle Tracker **Defense Grid** (bottom left).

|------|--------|---------|
| KETCH | 5 letters | PIANO |
| SHIP | 4 letters | JUMP |
| SUB | 3 letters | BED |
| ARK | 3 letters | RUN |
| PT | 2 letters | IF |

*Note: Ship names are just fun naval-themed labels‚Äîthey don't affect gameplay and simply correspond to word lengths!*

- Place left to right horizontally or top to bottom vertically only, no diagonals
- Ships may touch edges but cannot overlap
- All words must be in the agreed upon language
- No proper nouns, abbreviations, hyphenated words, or suffixes


Fill out your **Defense Manifest**

## üì° Hailing the Enemy

Use launch codes and cunning to negotiate who fires the opening round!

### Opening Gambit Process

1. **Opening Gambit** ‚Äî One captain (the Initiator) calls out a real or fake launch code

2. **Response** ‚Äî The other captain (the Defender) has three choices:
   - **Concede** ‚Äî The Initiator goes first
   - **Challenge** ‚Äî If it was a real code, the Initiator goes first. If not, the Defender goes first
   - **Counter** ‚Äî The Defender calls out a higher launch code (real or fake) and becomes the new Initiator

3. **Resolution** ‚Äî The process repeats until someone concedes or challenges

*Launch codes are the five 3-digit numbers printed on your Battle Tracker*

###Give the Command, Captain!

On your turn, call out a grid coordinate to fire.

| Example: "F9!"

Your opposing captain replies to your attack.

--------

"**Miss!**" There is no Word Ship at that coordinate.
CAPTAIN'S LOG: Place a dot at the center of the coordinate on the Attack Grid.
FURTHER ACTION: Your turn is over. No further action.

"**Hit.**" There is a Word Ship at that coordinate.
CAPTAIN'S LOG: With a pen or a highlighter, trace the coordinate's border on the Attack Grid.
FURTHER ACTION: Your turn is **NOT** over! Call a letter.

| Example: "S!"

"**Bullseye.**" The letter called is at the coordinate called!
CAPTAIN'S LOG: Write the letter in the coordinate on the Attack Grid.
FURTHER ACTION: Your turn is over. No further action.

"**0 - ?.**" How many times your letter appears in their fleet.
CAPTAIN'S LOG: Write the number on your Attack Manifest in the appropriate letter box.
FURTHER ACTION: Your turn is over. No further action.
