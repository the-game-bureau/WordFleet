Here's a comprehensive prompt to recreate the current Word Fleet web page:

**Create a modern, sleek web page for "Word Fleet" - a strategic naval-themed game that combines Wordle and Battleship mechanics. The page should have these exact specifications:**

**🎨 Design Aesthetic:**
- Dark navy background (#0a0e1a) with a futuristic, military command center feel
- Glassmorphism design throughout with backdrop blur effects and translucent panels
- Modern typography using system fonts (Apple/Google/Microsoft default stacks)
- Sophisticated color scheme with deep blues, translucent whites, and green terminal accents

**📱 Layout & Structure:**
- Fully responsive design that works perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Maximum width container (1400px) centered on page
- Three main content sections in a grid: "Attack Grid" (2x width), "Enemy Ships", and "Letters"
- Clean print-optimized version that converts to black and white

**🎯 Header Section:**
- Large gradient text title "WORD FLEET" with blue-to-green-to-yellow color transition
- Subtitle "Pen & Paper Edition" in small caps
- Two navigation buttons: "HOME" and "RULES OF ENGAGEMENT" with pill-shaped borders
- Interactive launch code display in top-right corner showing "LAUNCH CODE*: [random 1-10]"
- Launch code should be clickable with hover effects (scale/glow)

**💥 Interactive Launch Code Popup:**
- When launch code is clicked, show full-screen overlay with blur backdrop
- Military-styled popup window with glassmorphism effect
- Green accent colors matching terminal aesthetic
- Title: "Battle Launch Protocol"
- Content: "Add launch codes from upper right coordinates of both Battle Trackers. Odd total: Fleet 1 initiates first strike. Even total: Fleet 2 does."
- Close with X button, clicking outside, or Escape key
- Smooth fade-in animation

**🎮 Main Content Sections:**
- Three cards with subtle borders, hover animations (lift effect), and glassmorphism
- Each section has emoji icon (⚔️ for Attack Grid, 🚢 for Enemy Ships, 🔤 for Letters)
- Placeholder text describing each section's purpose
- Cards should have subtle glow effects on hover

**⚓ Footer:**
- Protocol explanation in highlighted box
- Credits: "WORD FLEET - Pen & Paper Edition • by Kevin M.Kolb • thegamebureau.com"
- Same glassmorphism styling as rest of page

**🎯 Technical Requirements:**
- Generate random launch code (1-10) on each page load
- Smooth CSS transitions and hover effects throughout
- Mobile-first responsive design with proper breakpoints
- Print styles that hide interactive elements and convert to black/white
- Clean HTML5 structure with semantic elements
- No external dependencies - pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript

**✨ Visual Polish:**
- Subtle animations and micro-interactions
- Consistent spacing and typography hierarchy
- Professional color palette with excellent contrast
- Modern button and card styling with rounded corners
- Backdrop blur effects where appropriate
- Smooth scaling and shadow effects on interactive elements

**🌊 Atmosphere:**
- Naval command center aesthetic
- High-tech military interface feel
- Clean, professional, and game-ready
- Balance between excitement and readability
- Premium web app quality with attention to detail

The final result should look like a cutting-edge naval strategy game interface that professional game studios would create, with perfect responsiveness and polished interactions throughout.
