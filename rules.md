Place 5 Word Ships on your Battle Tracker Defense Grid (bottom left). Choose auto-generated or player-chosen Word Ships. Both players must choose the same type..

KETCH: 5-letter word (e.g., PIANO)
SHIP: 4-letter word (e.g., JUMP)
SUB: 3-letter word (e.g., BED)
ARK: 3-letter word (e.g., RUN)

Placement Rules:

Word ships must be valid English words

Ships may touch edges but cannot overlap
No diagonals, proper nouns, abbreviations, hyphenated words, or suffixes

### Classified Manifest (right side)
- Count each letter in your full fleet
- Record totals after placing your ships

### Gameplay

Captains take turns launching attacks.

Call out a grid coordinate.

**Possible results:**
- **Miss:** No ship present, no information given
- **Bullseye:** Correct letter in correct spot
- **Hit & Yes:** Wrong letter in that spot, but letter exists in fleet (opponent states count)
- **Hit & No:** Wrong letter and letter not in fleet (opponent states 0)






Track your attacks on your opponent:
- **Bullseyes:** Write correct letter in a circle
- **Hits:** X with guessed letter (wrong letter, correct location)
- **Misses:** Use a dot
- Cross out completed ships once fully revealed



### Recording Results
- Use colors or symbols to record attack results
- Track letter confirmations, misses, and hits on your Attack Grid


### Recon Log (top right)
Record Letter Sweep results:
- Circle letters that appear in opponent's fleet
- Cross out letters with zero count
- Note exact counts next to each letter
- Prioritize vowels for early sweeps

## üì° Determining First Player

Use launch codes and cunning to negotiate who fires the opening round!

### Opening Gambit Process

1. **Opening Gambit** ‚Äî One captain (the Initiator) calls out a real or fake launch code

2. **Response** ‚Äî The other captain (the Defender) has three choices:
   - **Concede** ‚Äî The Initiator goes first
   - **Challenge** ‚Äî If it was a real code, the Initiator goes first. If not, the Defender goes first
   - **Counter** ‚Äî The Defender calls out a higher launch code (real or fake) and becomes the new Initiator

3. **Resolution** ‚Äî The process repeats until someone concedes or challenges

*Launch codes are the five 3-digit numbers printed on your Battle Tracker*

## Game Summary

Word Fleet is a 2-player strategic word game that blends Battleship¬Æ and Wordle¬Æ mechanics.

**Setup:** Players use a bluffing mini-game (Launch Codes) to determine turn order, then place 5 word ships (valid English words) horizontally or vertically on a hidden 10√ó10 grid.

**Gameplay:** On each turn, players either perform a Letter Sweep (ask how many of a letter) or a Coordinate Attack (guess letter at grid position). Results include Miss, Hit, and Bullseye. Players use deduction to reveal and sink opponent ships.

**Victory:** Sink all five enemy ships by identifying every letter in each word.

Word Fleet rewards strategic thinking, vocabulary knowledge, and clever deduction. May the best captain command the sea!
