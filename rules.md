RESPONSE ‚Äî The other captain (the Defender) has three choices:
CONCEDE ‚Äî The Initiator goes first.
CHALLENGE ‚Äî If it was a real code, the Initiator goes first. If not, the Defender goes first.
COUNTER ‚Äî The Defender calls out a higher launch code (real or fake) and becomes the new Initiator.
RESOLUTION ‚Äî The process repeats until someone concedes or challenges.

‚Ä¢	Each player places 5 word ships (valid English words) horizontally or vertically on a hidden 10x10 grid
Gameplay:
‚Ä¢	On each turn, players either perform a Letter Sweep (ask how many of a letter) or a Coordinate Attack (guess letter at grid position)
