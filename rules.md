# WORD FLEET
Pen & Paper Mode â€¢ by Kevin Kolb â€¢ [the-game-bureau.github.io/WordFleet](https://the-game-bureau.github.io/WordFleet)
## Rules of Engagement

<!-- 002-MISSION SPECS -->

### Mission Specs

Word Fleet combines the strategy of *BattleshipÂ®* with the linguistic challenge of *WordleÂ®*.

**PERSONNEL:** 2 Captains  
**MINIMUM AGE:** 10  
**MISSION DURATION:** 15â€“30 minutes

<!-- 003-REQUISITION -->

### Requisition

* 2 Battle Tracker sheets from [https://the-game-bureau.github.io/WordFleet](https://the-game-bureau.github.io/WordFleet)  
* 2 marking instruments (pen/pencil)  
* 2 highlighters (optional tactical enhancement)

<!-- 004-FLEET DEPLOYMENT -->

### Fleet Deployment

Choose deployment method: auto-generated or operator-selected Word-Ships. Both commanders must use the same configuration. Deploy 5 Word-Ships on the Defense Grid (lower left section).

| Vessel Class | Length    | Example Designation |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------|
| KETCH        | 5 letters | PIANO               |
| SHIP         | 4 letters | JUMP                |
| SUB          | 3 letters | BED                 |
| ARK          | 3 letters | RUN                 |
| PT           | 2 letters | IF                  |

> **NOTE:** Vessel classifications are operational designations only â€” they correspond to word length and do not affect tactical capabilities.

* Word-Ships must read left-to-right or top-to-bottom only. No diagonals, backwards, or bottom-to-top placements.  
* Ships may touch in any manner but cannot overlap.  
* All words must be in an agreed-upon language.  
* No proper nouns, abbreviations, hyphenated words, or suffixes.

### Defense Manifest

Inventory each letter in your fleet and record totals in your Defense Manifest (lower right) if it has not been done for you. This will help during game play.

<!-- 005-HAILING THE ENEMY -->

## ðŸ“¡ Hailing the Enemy ðŸ“¡
A Mini-Game to Determine First Strike

Each Captain has 5 secret Launch Codes (000â€“999) stamped on their Battle Tracker.

### Goal

Secure the right to fire first in battle.

### How to Play

1. **Opening Hail**: One Captain calls out any 3-digit code (real or fake).  
2. **Response Options**:  
   * **Concede** â†’ Caller fires first.  
   * **Challenge** â†’ Caller must reveal their stamped codes:  
     * Code is there: Caller fires first.  
     * Code is fake: Responder fires first.  
   * **Counter** â†’ Call a higher code (real or fake) and become the new caller.  
3. Continue until someone concedes or challenges.

### Key Rules

* Codes remain secret unless challenged.  
* Equal codes are valid (both players could have 777).

> Remember: High codes are powerful but rare. Bluff wisely!

<!-- 006-COMBAT -->

### Combat

On their turn the captain calls out a target coordinate (e.g., "E-7") to try to hit an opponent's word-ship.

The opponent responds with "HIT!" or "MISS!":

If itâ€™s a MISS, (a word-ship IS NOT at that coordinate)
- A dot is placed in the center of that coordinate and the captain's turn ends.

If itâ€™s a HIT, (a word-ship IS at that coordinate)
- The attacking Captain highlights the border of that coordinate in their Attack Grid.
- As a reward for a successful hit, the attacking captain calls out a letter for that coordinate (e.g., "S").

The opponent responds with "BULLSEYE!" or "TALLY [NUMBER] [LETTERS]S":

If it's a BULLSEYE, (That letter is at that coordinate)
- The letter is written in that coordinate and the Captain's turn ends.

If it's a TALLY [NUMBER] [LETTERS]S, (The number of occurences of that letter in the fleet)
- The number is recorded on the Attack Manifest (upper right) and the Captain's turn ends.

Once all of a word-ship's letters are revealed, the attacking captain is told the word-ship has been sunk (e.g., "You sank my sub!").

Turns alternate back and forth until all of one player's word-ships have been sunk.




DEFENSE
The defender also marks their Defense Grid and Defense Manifest to track attacks against them.
Defense Operations
Mark dots for enemy misses on Defense Grid
Highlight perimeters for confirmed hits on Defense Grid
Cross out destroyed vessels upon enemy word identification




VICTORY
First player to sink all five of the opponentâ€™s ships wins.









Vessel Destruction Protocol
When confident of complete word identification, announce full designation instead of coordinates. Correct identification results in vessel destruction. Incorrect attempts terminate your turn and prevent future attempts on that word designation.






at start of turn can guess a word.


## Defense Operations

* Mark dots for enemy misses on Defense Grid
* Highlight perimeters for confirmed hits on Defense Grid
* Cross out destroyed vessels upon enemy word identification

## Victory

Achieve victory by completely identifying and destroying all five enemy Word Ships through precise letter detection and word reconstruction.

#### Themed Battles

* Biological: ZEBRA, FROG, COW, BAT, OX
* Nutritional: PASTA, MILK, PIE, TEA, EGG
* Environmental: CLOUD, TREE, SUN, SKY, ICE

#### Asymmetric Warfare Protocol

One operator deploys custom-selected high-difficulty words while opponent uses auto-generated standard designations.
