WORD FLEET
Pen & Paper Mode • by Kevin Kolb • the-game-bureau.github.io/WordFleet
Rules of Engagement

PERSONNEL: 2 Captains
MINIMUM AGE: 10
MISSION DURATION: 15-30 minutes

Word Fleet combines the strategy of Battleship® with the linguistic challenge of Wordle®.

Requisition
2 Battle Tracker sheets from https://the-game-bureau.github.io/WordFleet
2 marking instruments (pen/pencil)
2 highlighters (optional tactical enhancement)

Fleet Deployment Protocol
Choose deployment method: auto-generated or operator-selected Word Ships. Both commanders must use identical protocols. Deploy 5 Word Ships on Defense Grid (lower section).

Vessel Class	Length	Example Designation
KETCH	5 letters	PIANO
SHIP	4 letters	JUMP
SUB	3 letters	BED
ARK	3 letters	RUN
PT	2 letters	IF

Vessel classifications are operational designations only—they correspond to word length and do not affect tactical capabilities.

Deployment Restrictions:
Horizontal (left-to-right) or vertical (top-to-bottom) orientation only, no diagonals
Ships may touch edges but cannot overlap
All words must be in agreed upon language
No proper nouns, abbreviations, hyphenated words, or suffixes
Defense Manifest Completion:
Inventory each letter in your fleet and record totals in your Defense Manifest (lower right) if it has not been done for you. This will help speed up combat.

**Hailing the Enemy - A Mini Game Within the Game**

Use your 3-Digit Launch Codes on your Battle Tracker and your cunning to negotiate who fires the opening round!

**First Contact**
Either Captain calls out a real or fake Launch Code.

**Response**
The other Captain has three choices:

**1) Concede** - The Initiator goes first.

**2) Challenge** - If it was a real code, the Initiator goes first. If not, the Defender goes first.

**3) Counter** - The Defender calls out a higher launch code (real or fake) and becomes the new Initiator.

**Resolution** - The process repeats until someone concedes or challenges.

Combat Operations

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On your operational turn, transmit grid coordinates for target acquisition.

EXAMPLE TRANSMISSION: "F9!"
Enemy operator responds based on coordinate analysis:

"Miss!"
No Word Ship detected at specified coordinates.

"Hit!"
Word Ship confirmed at target coordinates.

Combat & Victory
After Letter Transmission:
"Bullseye!"
Letter confirmed at exact specified coordinates

"[Number] total"
Frequency count of specified letter across entire enemy fleet

Vessel Destruction Protocol
When confident of complete word identification, announce full designation instead of coordinates. Correct identification results in vessel destruction. Incorrect attempts terminate your turn and prevent future attempts on that word designation.

Defense Operations
Mark dots for enemy misses on Defense Grid
Highlight perimeters for confirmed hits on Defense Grid
Cross out destroyed vessels upon enemy word identification
Mission Success
Achieve victory by completely identifying and destroying all five enemy Word Ships through precise letter detection and word reconstruction.
