## SETUP

### 1. Choose Your Words
Let Neptune pick your words or select your own 5 words that match your fleet requirements:
- **Valid Words:** Common English dictionary words only
- **No Proper Nouns:** No names, places, or brands
- **No Abbreviations:** No acronyms or shortened words
- **All Different:** Each word must be unique

### 2. Deploy Your Fleet
Place each Word Ship on your Defense Grid:
- **Horizontal or Vertical:** Left-to-right or top-to-bottom only
- **No Diagonals:** Words cannot be placed diagonally
- **No Overlapping:** Each grid square can hold only one letter
- **Touching Allowed:** Word Ships may touch at edges or corners
- **Consecutive Letters:** All letters must be in adjacent squares

### 3. Complete Your Battle Tracker
- Write your words in "My Word Ships"
- Count your letters in "Your Letter Manifest"
- Keep your Defense Grid hidden from your opponent

### 4. Determine First Captain
Youngest Captain calls "Even" or "Odd," then add both launch codes from your Battle Trackers. If the sum matches the call, they go first.

## HOW TO PLAY

Captains alternate turns attacking each other's fleets.

### YOUR TURN
On your turn, you must **call out a letter** or **declare a Word Ship**.

#### Step 1: Call Out a Letter
Choose any letter A-Z and ask: *"Any R's in your fleet?"*

#### Step 2: Opponent Responds
Your opponent must honestly reveal:
- **Hit:** "R at A5 and C7" (all positions where that letter appears)
- **Miss:** "No R's"

#### Step 3: Record the Result
- Mark hits on your Battle Grid
- Cross off the called letter in "Mark Used Letters"
- Update "Enemy Word Ships" with any new information

#### Step 4: Declare a Word Ship (Optional)
If you think you know one of your opponent's words, declare it:
*"I think HOUSE is one of your word ships!"*

**‚úÖ Correct Declaration**
- That Word Ship is immediately destroyed
- The exact coordinates are confirmed by the Captain
- Call another letter, but no more declarations this turn

**‚ùå Wrong Declaration**
- Your turn ends immediately
- Your opponent gets a second letter if their first letter is a hit
