<center>Rules of Engagement</center>

## 🗺️ Mission Overview

You are a naval commander in a battle of wits and words. Deploy your fleet, then hunt down the enemy using strategic attacks. When the smoke clears, only one fleet remains afloat.

Each commander places their fleet of 5 word-ships on a 10×10 grid, then takes turns either gathering intelligence about the opponent's letters or launching direct attacks at specific coordinates. Victory comes to the first player who sinks all enemy word-ships by correctly identifying every letter in their opponent's fleet.

## ⚓ Prepare for Battle

### 1) Requisition Supplies
- 2 Battle Trackers (one per commander) from **thegamebureau.com/wrdflt**
- 2 Pens or Pencils
- 2 Highlighters (optional)

### 2) Deploy Your Fleet

Your **Defense Grid** is a 10×10 grid (A–J horizontally, 1–10 vertically) located at the bottom of your Battle Tracker. Place your 5 Word-Ships by writing one letter per coordinate.

#### Word-Ship Requirements

Before deploying, both commanders must agree on **one** method:
- **Auto-Generated:** Use the pre-selected words printed on your tracker
- **Choose Your Own:** Select your own words following word-ship size requirements

> **Important:** Both players must use the same method—no mixing allowed!

- Must be real English words
- Placed horizontally or vertically only
- Cannot overlap but may touch
- No proper nouns, abbreviations, or punctuation

#### Your Fleet Composition

| Ship Type | Length | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **KETCH** | 5 letters | STORM |
| **SHIP** | 4 letters | WAVE |
| **SUB** | 3 letters | FOG |
| **ARK** | 3 letters | SEA |
| **PT** | 2 letters | GO |

### Defense Manifest

After placing your word-ships, count how many of each letter appears across your entire fleet and record these totals in your Defense Manifest. If you're playing with auto-generated word-ships, the Defense Manifest will be auto-populated. The Defense Manifest speeds up gameplay when opponents gather intelligence.

## ⚔️ The Battle Begins

### Launch Gambit Protocol

Determine who strikes first using the launch codes on your battle tracker.

Your tracker displays 5 three-digit launch codes (like 142, 087, 953). Turn order is determined through a bidding system.

#### The Bidding War

1. **Opening Bid:** Claim to have a specific launch code (real or bluffed)
2. **Response Options:**
   - Concede and let them go first
   - Challenge their claim (call their bluff)
   - Counter with a higher bid (a rarer code)
3. **Challenge Results:**
   - **If bluffing:** Challenger gets TWO opening turns
   - **If truthful:** Original bidder gets TWO opening turns

> ⚠️ **Once bidding ends, ALL gameplay must be honest—no more bluffing allowed!**

## 🎮 Gameplay

Each turn, choose **ONE** action:

### 🔍 Gather Intelligence

**Action:** Name any letter of the alphabet
- Opponent reveals total count of that letter in their fleet
- Each letter can only be asked once per game
- Record the count in your Attack Manifest

**Example:** *"How many R's?" → "I have 2 R's"*

### 🎯 Direct Attack

**Action:** Call out Coordinates AND a Letter
- **🗺️ Bullseye:** Your letter matches exactly at those coordinates → write the found letter in the square
- **💥 Hit:** Coordinate is part of a Word-Ship, but different letter → trace or highlight the border
- **🌊 Miss:** Empty water → place a dot in the center

**Example:** *"B4 - T" → "Hit" (word-ship at B4, but not a T)*

### Your Battle Station Layout

#### Attack Grid (Top Left)
Track your attacks on the enemy fleet

#### Attack Manifest (Top Right)
Track intelligence gathering:
- ⭕ Circle letters that exist in opponent's fleet
- ❌ Cross out letters with zero count
- Write the exact count next to each letter
- Vowels are pre-highlighted as priority targets

## 🏆 Victory Conditions

**The first commander to sink all five enemy word-ships wins!**

Ships sink when all their letters are correctly identified through bullseyes. Track your progress and deduce enemy words from successful attack patterns.
