# Word Fleet
## Rules of Engagement

### Mission Overview

You are a naval commander in a battle of wits and words. Deploy your fleet, then hunt down the enemy using strategic attacks. When the smoke clears, only one fleet remains afloat.

### Prepare for Battle

#### Requisition Supplies

- 2 Printed Battle Trackers; One for each captain (thegamebureau.com/wrdflt)
- 2 Pens or Pencils
- 2 Highlighters (optional)

### Deploy Your Fleet

Your **Defense Grid** is 10×10 (A–J horizontally, 1–10 vertically) located at the bottom of your Battle Tracker. Place your 5 Word-Ships (listed above the grid on the right) by writing one letter per coordinate. Ships must be real English words placed horizontally or vertically. Ships cannot overlap but may touch. No proper nouns, abbreviations, or words requiring punctuation. Keep your grid hidden.

- **KETCH:** 5-letter word (example: STORM)
- **SHIP:** 4-letter word (example: WAVE)
- **SUB:** 3-letter word (example: FOG)
- **ARK:** 3-letter word (example: SEA)
- **PT:** 2-letter word (example: GO)

The **Classified Manifest** (located beside your **Defense Grid**) speeds up gameplay. After placing your ships, count how many of each letter appears across your entire fleet and record these totals. You'll use this for quick responses when opponents gather intelligence.

### The Battle Begins
On your turn, you must choose **ONE** of the following actions:

**GATHER INTELLIGENCE**
Name any letter of the alphabet
- Opponent reveals total count of that letter in their fleet
- Record the answer in the **LETTER RECON** area at the top right of your tracker

"How many R's are in your fleet?" Opponent: "I have 2 R's."

**DIRECT ATTACK**
Call out Coordinates AND a Letter
- **Bullseye:** Your letter and coordinates match exactly. Write the letter at the proper coordinates on the **Attack Grid**.
- **Hit:** There's a ship there, but wrong letter. Trace the border of the coordinates you hit or highlight it.
- **Miss:** You hit empty water. Place a dot in the middle of the coordinate.

"B4 - T" Opponent: "Hit" (there's a ship at B4, but it's not a T)



### Intelligence Tracking

#### Attack Grid (Top Left)

Use this grid to track all attacks on your opponent:
- Mark bullseyes with the correct letter in a circle
- Mark hits with an X and note which letter you guessed
- Mark misses with dots
- Draw lines through confirmed sunken ships when all letters are found

#### Recon Log (Top Right)

Track your Intelligence Gathering systematically:
- Circle letters that exist in opponent's fleet
- Cross out letters with zero count
- Write the exact count next to each letter asked about
- Vowels are highlighted as high-priority targets

### Mission Accomplished

**The first captain to sink all five enemy ships wins the battle!**

Ships sink when all their letters are correctly identified through attacks. Track your progress and deduce the enemy words from the pattern of bullseyes!

### Contingency Tactics

**Silent Service:** When answering Intelligence Gathering, don't reveal which ships contain the letter—only the total count.

**Themed Fleets:** Both players must use words from agreed categories (animals, colors, military terms, etc.).

**Minefield:** Each player places 1 mine on their defense grid. If the opponent hits it, the defending captain immediately gets two full turns in a row. The mine is revealed when struck.

### Final Briefing

#### Turn Summary

1. Choose: Gather Intelligence OR Attack
2. Record all information on your trackers
3. Pass turn to opponent

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Asking about the same letter twice
- Forgetting to track letter counts
- Not recording whether attacks were bullseyes, hits, or misses
- Placing ships diagonally (not allowed)

*"In the fog of war, every letter tells a story. Listen carefully, strike decisively, and may fair winds fill your sails, Captain."*

### Shipyard: Under Construction

#### Launch Sequence

Determine who strikes first using the launch codes on your battle tracker.

#### Reading Your Launch Codes

Your tracker displays 5 three-digit launch codes (like 142, 087, 953). These codes determine turn order through a bidding system.

#### The Bidding War

1. **Opening Bid:** You or your opponent claims to have a specific launch code (real or bluffed)
2. **Response Options:**
   - Concede and let them go first
   - Challenge their claim (call their bluff)
   - Counter with a higher bid (a rarer code)
3. **Challenge Results:**
   - If bluffing: Challenger gets TWO opening turns
   - If truthful: Original bidder gets TWO opening turns

**Once bidding ends, ALL gameplay must be honest—no more bluffing allowed!**

#### Word Selection

Before starting, agree with your opponent on one method:
- **Auto-Generated Words:** Use the pre-selected words printed on your tracker
- **Choose Your Own:** Select your own words following the ship size requirements

*Both players must use the same method—no mixing allowed!*
