    <p>WORD FLEET - Rules of Engagement</p>
    <p>Word Fleet combines the strategic depth of naval combat with the intellectual challenge of word puzzles. Two admirals command fleets of letter-ships, using vocabulary as their primary weapon system.</p>
    
    <h3>FLEET COMPOSITION</h3>
    <p>Your fleet consists of 5 word-ships of varying lengths:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Aircraft Carrier:</strong> 5-letter word</li>
        <li><strong>Battleship:</strong> 4-letter word</li>
        <li><strong>Cruiser:</strong> 3-letter word</li>
        <li><strong>Destroyer:</strong> 3-letter word</li>
        <li><strong>Submarine:</strong> 2-letter word</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>SETUP PHASE</h3>
    <p>Secretly position your word-ships on your defense grid. Place ships horizontally or vertically only - words must read left-to-right (horizontal) or top-to-bottom (vertical). Ships cannot overlap or touch each other, even at corners.</p>
    
    <h3>DETERMINING FIRST STRIKE</h3>
    <p>Before battle begins, admirals must determine who fires first using the Launch Code Protocol:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Opening Bid:</strong> One admiral declares their highest launch code digit (0-9)</li>
        <li><strong>Response Options:</strong> The other admiral may:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Concede:</strong> "You may fire first" (bidding ends, first admiral attacks)</li>
                <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> "Prove it!" (proceed to verification)</li>
                <li><strong>Raise:</strong> Declare a higher number (bidding continues)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Continued Bidding:</strong> Admirals alternate raising or challenging until someone concedes or challenges</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Challenge Resolution:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The challenged admiral must reveal their launch code section (while hiding all other information)</li>
        <li><strong>Liar Caught:</strong> If they lied, the honest admiral gets TWO consecutive turns to start</li>
        <li><strong>False Accusation:</strong> If they told the truth, they get TWO consecutive turns to start</li>
        <li><strong>Note:</strong> An admiral may concede at any time to avoid being caught in a lie</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>COMBAT PHASE</h3>
    
    <h4>Turn Structure</h4>
    <p>Each turn consists of two phases:</p>
    
    <p><strong>1. Word Declaration Phase (Optional)</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attempt to sink an enemy ship by declaring its exact word and starting position</li>
        <li>State coordinates and spell the word (e.g., B3: ARMOR)</li>
        <li>The word extends either horizontally or vertically from the starting position</li>
        <li>Only one word declaration allowed per turn</li>
        <li>You may skip this phase</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>2. Attack Phase (Choose One)</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Coordinate Attack:</strong> Call specific grid coordinates (e.g., D5) - receive "Hit" or "Miss" with no letter information</li>
        <li><strong>Letter Attack:</strong> Call one letter (e.g., R) - receive total count across all ships, no location information (e.g., "3 Rs")</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><em>Important: Each letter can only be called once per game, even if multiple instances exist in the enemy fleet.</em></p>
    
    <h4>Attack Resolution</h4>
    
    <p><strong>Word Declarations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Correct:</strong> Ship immediately sinks, continue with your attack phase</li>
        <li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Your turn ends immediately (forfeit attack phase)</li>
        <li><strong>Invalid Position:</strong> If the declared word doesn't fit on the grid from stated coordinates, your turn ends immediately</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Coordinate Attacks:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hit:</strong> Opponent says "Hit!" - no additional information given</li>
        <li><strong>Miss:</strong> Opponent says "Miss!"</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Letter Attacks:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hit:</strong> Opponent announces total count only (e.g., "3 Rs" or "1 Q")</li>
        <li><strong>Miss:</strong> Opponent says "0" or "None"</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Ship Status</h4>
    <p>Ships sink when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All letters are hit through letter calling, OR</li>
        <li>The complete word is correctly declared with proper starting coordinates</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>VICTORY CONDITIONS</h3>
    <p>The first admiral to sink all enemy word-ships claims victory and naval supremacy!</p>
    
    <h3>STRATEGIC NOTES</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose word-ships carefully - common letters make you vulnerable, but obscure words might be harder to remember under pressure</li>
        <li>Balance offensive vocabulary knowledge with defensive positioning</li>
        <li>Use revealed letter positions to deduce word patterns and ship orientations</li>
        <li>Consider letter frequency when planning attacks</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>PEN & PAPER MODE</h2>
    
    <h3>Battle Tracker Layout</h3>
    <p>Your Battle Tracker divides into three essential sections:</p>
    
    <p><strong>ATTACK GRID (Top Section)</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Track attacks on the enemy fleet using this 10×10 grid (A-J, 1-10)</li>
        <li>Mark hits with letters, misses with dots</li>
        <li>Ship indicators (5-4-3-3-2) remind you of enemy fleet composition</li>
        <li>"Fired Letters" manifest tracks which letters you've already called</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>MIDDLE SECTION</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Contains your fleet name, launch codes, and optionally your word-ships</li>
        <li>Launch codes determine who attacks first</li>
        <li>Word-ships section helps you remember your fleet during battle</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>DEFENSE GRID (Bottom Section)</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your secret fleet positioning - guard this from enemy eyes!</li>
        <li>Place your 5 word-ships on this 10×10 grid during setup</li>
        <li>"Letter Manifest" shows each letter count in your fleet for quick reference during letter attacks</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Attack Tracking</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Fired Letters Manifest:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Circle letters that score hits, cross out letters that miss</li>
        <li>Write the hit count in the letter tile for reference</li>
        <li>Remember: each letter can only be called once per game</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Attack Grid:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mark coordinate attacks: write the letter for hits, place a dot for misses</li>
        <li>Use gathered intelligence to plan word declarations</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>OPTIONAL RULES</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Dictionary Challenge:</strong> Challenge questionable words and consult an agreed-upon dictionary. Replace invalid words during setup.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Theme Fleets:</strong> All ships must follow a specific theme (animals, foods, naval terms, etc.).</p>
    
    <p><strong>Radar Sweep:</strong> Once per game, choose a 3×3 area and learn if it contains any ship parts (but not which letters or words).</p>
    
    <p><strong>Silent Running:</strong> Advanced players may choose not to reveal specific locations when announcing letter hits, providing only the total count.</p>
