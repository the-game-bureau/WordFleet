## üì° Hailing the Enemy

First strike advantage is everything. Use your launch codes and psychological warfare to claim it!
THE OBJECTIVE
Bid increasingly higher launch codes until someone either backs down (concedes) or demands proof (challenges). If challenged, you win with a real code or lose with a fake one. Bluff wisely!
HOW TO PLAY
STEP 1: INITIATE
One captain (the Initiator) broadcasts a launch code (real or bluff):

"This is Captain [Name]. Launch authorization: Code 247. Stand down or respond."

STEP 2: RESPOND
The other captain (the Defender) must choose ONE:
üè≥Ô∏è CONCEDE ‚Äî Accept that the Initiator has a higher code.

Result: The Initiator goes first


"Code acknowledged. You have tactical priority."

üîç CHALLENGE ‚Äî Demand proof of that code.

If the Initiator's code is REAL ‚Üí Initiator goes first
If the Initiator's code is FAKE ‚Üí Defender goes first


"Verify that code, Captain. I'm calling your bluff."

üéØ COUNTER ‚Äî Claim to have an even higher code (real or bluff)

The Defender becomes the new Initiator
The original Initiator becomes the new Defender


"Negative. I'm transmitting Code 358. Your move."

STEP 3: ESCALATE
Players swap Initiator/Defender roles with each counter. Continue until someone concedes or challenges.
KEY RULES

Each counter must use a HIGHER number than the previous
Launch codes = the five 3-digit numbers on your Battle Tracker
Bluffing is encouraged - but risky!
Once revealed, a code can't be reused

EXAMPLE EXCHANGE
Captain Red (Initiator): "Launch Code 156. Yield or respond."
Captain Blue (Defender): "Override with Code 289." [COUNTER - Blue is now Initiator]
Captain Red (now Defender): "Escalating to Code 445." [COUNTER - Red is now Initiator]
Captain Blue (now Defender): "...I challenge! Show me that code."
Captain Red: [Reveals Code 445 from Battle Tracker] "Verified. I fire first."

### Gameplay

Each turn has two steps:

**Step 1:** Call out a grid coordinate (e.g., "C7")
- **Hit:** Ship present at that coordinate
- **Miss:** No ship at that coordinate

**Step 2:** If you got a Hit, call out a letter (e.g., "M")
- **Bullseye:** Correct letter at that coordinate
- **Yes:** Wrong letter at that coordinate, but that letter exists somewhere in your fleet
- **No:** Wrong letter at that coordinate, and that letter does not exist anywhere in your fleet

### Recording Results
- Mark Misses with dots on your Attack Grid
- Mark Hits with the guessed letter and result (circle for Bullseye, X for wrong letter)
- Track confirmed letters in your Attack Manifest

---

## üèÜ Victory

**Win Condition:** Sink all five of your opponent's word ships by correctly identifying every letter in each ship.

The first commander to sink all enemy ships wins the battle!

### Themed Fleets
Choose a shared category for all ships:
- Animals (ZEBRA, FROG, COW, BAT, OX)
- Foods (PASTA, MILK, PIE, TEA, EGG)
- Nature (CLOUD, TREE, SUN, SKY, ICE)

### Color Coding System

### Handicap Variant
One player creates custom words while the other uses auto-generated words.

## Game Summary

Word Fleet is a 2-player strategic word game that blends Battleship¬Æ and Wordle¬Æ mechanics.

**Setup:** Players use a bluffing mini-game (Launch Codes) to determine turn order, then place 5 word ships (valid English words) left-to-right or top-to-bottom on a hidden 10√ó10 grid.

**Gameplay:** Players take turns calling coordinates (Hit/Miss), then if Hit, calling letters (Bullseye/Yes/No). Use deduction to reveal and sink opponent ships.

**Victory:** Sink all five enemy ships by identifying every letter in each word.

**For Claude AI:** When playing Word Fleet, place your 5 word ships on a 10√ó10 grid (A-J columns, 1-10 rows). Words must be placed left-to-right or top-to-bottom only. Track player attacks and respond accurately with Hit/Miss, then Bullseye/Yes/No for letters. Remember word orientations and letter positions precisely.

Word Fleet rewards strategic thinking, vocabulary knowledge, and clever deduction. May the best captain command the sea!
