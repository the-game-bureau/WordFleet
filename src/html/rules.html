        <h1>Word Fleet • Rules of Engagement</h1>
        
        <div class="section-header">Mission Overview</div>
        <p>You are rival naval commanders in a battle of wits and words. Each captain secretly deploys a fleet of word-ships on their grid, then hunts down the enemy fleet using strategic letter attacks and precision coordinate strikes. The last fleet sailing claims victory.</p>
        
        <div class="section-header">Before You Begin</div>
        <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong> Print battle trackers from <a href="https://thegamebureau.com/wrdflt" target="_blank">thegamebureau.com/wrdflt</a>. Each captain needs a tracker, pen/pencil, and optionally a highlighter.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Word Rules:</strong> Before starting, both captains must agree: will you use the auto-generated words on your trackers, or choose your own? Both captains must use the same method.</p>
        
        <div class="section-header">How to Play</div>
        <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Each captain secretly places 5 word-ships on their defense grid. Words must be real English words written horizontally (left to right) or vertically (top to bottom).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Battle:</strong> Take turns attacking your opponent's fleet. You can either call out specific coordinates for targeted strikes, or sweep for letters to gather intelligence about the enemy fleet.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Victory:</strong> Use deduction to locate and sink all enemy vessels. When you think you know a word's location, announce it to score a devastating hit. First to sink the entire enemy fleet wins!</p>
        
        <div class="section-header">Code Breaking</div>
        <p><strong>The Stakes:</strong> Each captain receives 5 random launch codes on their tracker. These determine who strikes first.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Who Claims First:</strong> Both captains reveal the first digit of their first launch code and add them together. Count how many times this sum appears anywhere in your five launch codes. The captain with the highest count makes the first claim. If tied, the captain with the higher first digit claims first.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Bidding Process:</strong> One captain claims a launch code—either real (from their sheet) or bluffed. The opponent can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Concede and let them go first</li>
            <li>Challenge the claim</li>
            <li>Counter with a higher bid</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Challenge Results:</strong> If you challenge and they were bluffing, you get two opening turns. If their claim was true, they get two opening turns. Once bidding ends, all gameplay must be honest—no more bluffing allowed.</p>
        
        <div class="section-header">Prepare Your Defenses</div>
        
        <div class="subsection-header">Deploy Your Fleet</div>
        <p>Place your 5 word-ships on the defense grid (10×10, labeled A-J horizontally and 1-10 vertically). Write one letter per square. Ships cannot overlap but may sit adjacent to each other—even sharing sides. Keep this grid hidden from your opponent.</p>
        
        <div class="ship-list">
            <p><strong>Your Fleet Consists of:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>KETCH:</strong> 5-letter word</li>
                <li><strong>SHIP:</strong> 4-letter word</li>
                <li><strong>SUB:</strong> 3-letter word</li>
                <li><strong>ARK:</strong> 3-letter word</li>
                <li><strong>PT:</strong> 2-letter word</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="battle-tracker-note">
            <p><strong>Letter Inventory (Bottom Right):</strong> This alphabet chart tracks how many of each letter appear in your fleet. Auto-generated words come pre-counted. If choosing your own words, fill this in after placing your ships. Use it to quickly answer letter sweep attacks.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section-header">Attack Phase</div>
        
        <div class="subsection-header">Your Turn Structure</div>
        <p>Each turn consists of two parts:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Part 1 - Word Strike (Optional):</strong> If you think you've identified an enemy ship, announce its complete word and exact location (e.g., "STORM from B2 to F2"). If you're correct, that ship sinks immediately and you proceed to Part 2. If wrong about any detail, your turn ends immediately.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Part 2 - Intelligence Gathering:</strong> Choose one attack:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Coordinate Strike:</strong> Call any grid position (e.g., "D5"). Your opponent responds "Hit" (revealing the letter) or "Miss".</li>
            <li><strong>Letter Sweep:</strong> Name any letter (e.g., "E"). Your opponent reveals how many times that letter appears across their entire fleet. Each letter can only be swept once per game.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="subsection-header">Track Your Intelligence</div>
        <p>Use the attack grid (top left) to record all information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mark hits with circles containing the revealed letter</li>
            <li>Mark misses with dots</li>
            <li>Note letter sweep results in the margins</li>
            <li>Cross off sunk ships from the fleet roster</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="battle-tracker-note">
            <p><strong>Letter Intelligence (Top Right):</strong> This alphabet grid helps track your letter sweeps. Circle letters that scored hits, cross out letters with zero hits, and write the hit count in each box. Vowels are highlighted as prime targets.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section-header">Victory Conditions</div>
        <div class="important">
            The first captain to sink all five enemy ships wins the battle! Ships sink when all their letters are revealed through coordinate strikes or correctly identified in a word strike.
        </div>
        
        <div class="section-header">Captain's Strategy Guide</div>
        
        <div class="subsection-header">Tactical Advice</div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Word Selection:</strong> Balance common words (easier to remember) against uncommon letters (harder to find)</li>
            <li><strong>Early Game:</strong> Letter sweeps reveal the most information when you know the least</li>
            <li><strong>Mid Game:</strong> Focus coordinate strikes around confirmed hits to identify word patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Late Game:</strong> Combine letter counts with hit patterns to deduce complete words</li>
            <li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Vowel sweeps often yield high value—most words need them</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="game-variations">
            <div class="subsection-header">Optional Variations</div>
            
            <p><strong>Dictionary Defense:</strong> Allow word challenges. Keep a dictionary handy to verify disputed words.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Themed Fleets:</strong> Both captains must use words from the same category (animals, colors, foods, etc.).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Sonar Ping:</strong> Once per game, name a 3×3 grid area. Opponent reveals if it contains any ships (but not which ones or where).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Silent Running:</strong> When answering letter sweeps, only give the count—don't reveal which ships contain the letter.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="final-quote">
            <em>Fair winds and following seas, Captain. May your words strike true.</em>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section-header">WORKING SECTION - First Claim Methods</div>
        
        <div class="subsection-header">Method 1: Frequency Lock (Currently in Rules)</div>
        <p>Both captains reveal the first digit of their first launch code and add them together. Count how many times this sum appears anywhere in your five launch codes. The captain with the highest count makes the first claim. If tied, the captain with the higher first digit claims first.</p>
        
        <div class="subsection-header">Method 2: Risk & Reward (In Development)</div>
        <p>Both captains write down a 1 or a 2 and hide it. Reveal simultaneously:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Both show 1: Use a different tiebreaker method</li>
            <li>Both show 2: Use a different tiebreaker method</li>
            <li>One shows 1, other shows 2: The captain who showed 2 goes first AND gets two opening turns</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Still developing the tiebreaker methods for matching numbers...</em></p>
        
        <div class="subsection-header">Other Methods Considered:</div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Signal Flags:</strong> Show 1-5 fingers simultaneously, most flags wins</li>
            <li><strong>Flash Signal:</strong> First to flip hand after "Incoming transmission!"</li>
            <li><strong>Dead Reckoning:</strong> Write 1-10, closest to today's date wins</li>
            <li><strong>Radio Silence:</strong> First to knock after counting to 3</li>
            <li><strong>Frequency Match:</strong> Both say a letter, count instances in launch codes</li>
        </ul>
