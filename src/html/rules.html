## AHOY!

Word Fleet combines the tactical excitement of naval warfare with the intellectual challenge of word games. Players secretly deploy word ships on their grids, then engage in strategic combat to sink their opponent's vocabulary armada.

---

## Universal Rules

### Victory Condition
The first player to sink all of their opponent's Word Ships wins the battle.

### Fleet Composition
Each player commands a fleet of exactly five Word Ships:

- **üö¢ Flagship** - 1 Five-Letter Word Ship

## Alternate Play Modes

### Coordinate Calling Mode (Classic Battleship Style)
Traditional battleship-style gameplay with a word discovery twist:

#### Turn Sequence:
1. **Call Coordinate:** Player calls a grid position ("B-7")
2. **Response:** Opponent announces the letter at that position or "Miss"
3. **Mark Your Shot:** Use red pegs for hits, white pegs for misses on your Attack Grid
4. **Continue or Declare:** After a hit, choose to:
   - Call another coordinate (continue hunting)
   - Declare the word ("I think it's HOUSE")
5. **Turn End:** Turn ends after a miss or declaration attempt

**Example:**
```
Player calls "C-4" ‚Üí "H" (place red peg)
Player calls "C-5" ‚Üí "O" (place red peg)
Player calls "C-6" ‚Üí "Miss" (place white peg)
Turn ends, opponent's turn
```

### Salvo Mode (Advanced Battleship)
Call multiple coordinates based on your remaining fleet size:

#### Salvo Rules
- **Multiple Shots:** Call as many coordinates as you have unsunk Word Ships remaining
- **5 Ships = 5 Shots:** At game start, call 5 coordinates per turn
- **Diminishing Returns:** As ships sink, your shots per turn decrease
- **Simultaneous Fire:** Mark all shots with white pegs first, then get responses
- **Strategic Depth:** Plan coordinated attacks across multiple word targets

### Advanced Salvo Mode
For expert naval commanders:
- **Blind Fire:** Opponent only tells you total number of hits, not which shots hit
- **Pattern Analysis:** Must deduce hit locations from total hit count
- **Maximum Challenge:** Combines multiple shots with limited information

### Peg Tracking System
- **üî¥ Red Pegs** - Mark hits on your Attack Grid and hits on your ships when defending
- **‚ö™ White Pegs** - Mark misses on your Attack Grid to avoid wasting future shots
- **‚ö´ Black Pegs (Special)** - Optional "Stop Sign" pegs that backfire opponent's shot and give you 5 shots
- **üìä Visual Tracking** - Red pegs gradually reveal ship patterns and sizes for strategic planning

### Hybrid Mode
Combine both calling methods for maximum tactical flexibility:
- Players choose each turn whether to call a letter or coordinate
- Letter calls reveal all positions of that letter
- Coordinate calls reveal the specific letter at that position
- Adds strategic decision-making about information gathering methods

### Portable & Travel Variants

#### Paper & Pencil Classic
- **DIY Grids:** Draw 10√ó10 grids on paper (A-J, 1-10)
- **Mark System:** Use X for hits, O for misses
- **Dual Grids:** One for your ships, one to track attacks
- **Travel Ready:** No equipment needed beyond paper and pencil
- **Customizable:** Make larger grids (A-Z, 1-26) for extended play

### Advanced Variants
- **Scrambled Fleet** - Deploy letters in scrambled order (HOUSE ‚Üí H-S-U-O-E). Must declare the correct unscrambled word. Adds anagram challenge.
- **Theme Battles** - Restrict words to categories (Animals, Colors, Food). Both players use the same theme for balanced gameplay.
- **Timed Engagement** - 60-second turn limits prevent analysis paralysis. Recommended for tournament and competitive play.
- **Fleet Size Variants** - Quick Skirmish (3 words, 15 min) or Extended Campaign (7 words, 60 min) for different time commitments.

### Victory Declarations
Celebrate your victories with classic naval tradition:

```
"You sunk my BATTLESHIP!" (5-letter word)
"You sunk my CRUISER!" (4-letter word)
"You sunk my DESTROYER!" (3-letter word)
"You sunk my PATROL BOAT!" (2-letter word)
"Admiral, you've sunk my entire fleet!"
```

## Strategic Warfare

### Deployment Strategy

#### Letter Manifest Management
- **Letter Frequency:** Avoid too many common letters (E, A, R, S, T) that make words easy to guess
- **Strategic Overlap:** Share letters between words to confuse opponents about boundaries
- **Defensive Positioning:** Place longer words in less predictable grid locations

### Combat Tactics
- **High-Frequency Letters:** E, A, R, S, T, L, N reveal more info but help opponents deduce your words
- **Low-Frequency Letters:** Q, X, Z, J are safer calls but provide less information
- **Vowel Strategy:** Call vowels early to identify word patterns and structures
- **Consonant Clusters:** Look for common combinations (TH, ST, ER, ING, etc.)

### Advanced Deployment Tactics
- **Clustering** - Group shorter words together to create confusion about individual word boundaries
- **Corner Fortification** - Use grid edges for defensive advantage and limit opponent search angles
- **Decoy Patterns** - Create false patterns that mislead opponents about word locations and lengths
- **Psychological Warfare** - Use unexpected word choices and placements to throw off opponent expectations

## Victory and Scoring

### Standard Victory
First player to sink all enemy Word Ships wins the engagement.

### Tournament Scoring System
Points Awarded by Word Ship Length:
- **2-Letter Word Ship:** 2 points

# WORDFLEET
## Pen & Paper Edition
## Rules of Engagement

**For 2 Players**

## OBJECT OF THE GAME
Be the first to sink all 5 of your opponent's Word Ships before they sink yours.

## SUPPLIES
‚Ä¢ 2 Battle Tracker sheets (one for each Captain) from https://the-game-bureau.github.io/WordFleet
‚Ä¢ 2 Pens or Pencils
‚Ä¢ 2 Highlighetrs (optional)

## PREPARE FOR BATTLE
When printing your Battle Tracker you can have Neptune name your fleet and pick your Word Ships or you can name your fleet and make up your own Word Ships.






## ABOUT THE BATTLE TRACKER
The Battle Tracker is your command center for naval warfare. It contains everything you need to deploy your fleet, track your attacks, and record the status of your Word Ships.



Each player has 1 Battle Tracker sheet with 6 sections: Attack Grid, Enemy Fleet Status, Defense Grid, and Fleet Manifest.
### Your fleet of 5 Word Ships:
- **CARRIER**‚Äî5 letters
- **BATTLESHIP**‚Äî4 letters  
- **CRUISER**‚Äî3 holes
- **SUBMARINE**‚Äî3 holes
- **DESTROYER**‚Äî2 holes


You and your opponent sit facing each other, with your paper folded in half horizontally so your opponent can't see your Battle Tracker.

On the bottom half of your Battle Tracker, locate the My Word Ships section.
Secretly place your fleet of 5 ships on your ocean grid. To place each ship, fit its 2 anchoring pegs into 2 holes on your ocean grid. Your opponent does the same.

### Rules for placing ships:
‚Ä¢ Place each Word Ship in any horizontal or vertical position, but not diagonally.
‚Ä¢ Word Ships must read from left to right  must be placed in a straight line, either horizontally (left to right) or vertically (top to bottom).
‚Ä¢ Do not place a ship so that any part of it overlaps the edge of the grid or another ship.
‚Ä¢ Once the game has begun consider your ships anchored in place. You cannot move them.
‚Ä¢ Ships may touch at corners or edges, but they cannot overlap.

Battle Launch Protocol - No Coin Required
Youngest Captain Calls Even or Odd
Add Both Launch Codes from the Top of the Battle Trackers
If the Sum Matches the Call, They Fire the First Salvo
If Not, the Older Captain Opens Fire


# HOW TO PLAY
Decide who will go first. You and your opponent will alternate turns, calling out one shot per turn to try and hit each other's ships.

## CALL YOUR SHOT!
On your turn, pick a target hole on your upright target grid and call out its location by letter and number. Each target hole has a letter-number coordinate that corresponds with the same coordinate on your opponent's ocean grid. To determine each coordinate, find its corresponding letter on the left side of the target grid and its number on the top of the grid.

For example, the shot location in Figure 5 is D-4. When you call a shot, your opponent must tell you whether your shot is a hit or a miss.

## IT'S A HIT!
If you call out a shot location that is occupied by a ship on your opponent's ocean grid, your shot is a hit! Your opponent tells you which ship you have hit (cruiser, submarine, etc.). Record your hit by placing a red peg in the corresponding target hole on your target grid. Your opponent places a red peg in the corresponding hole of the ship you have hit on his or her ocean grid (see Figure 6).

**Example:** You and Alex are the players. It's your turn.

You call: "D-4."
Alex answers: "Hit. Cruiser."

You place a red peg in coordinate D-4 of your target grid. Alex places a red peg in the hole of his cruiser directly over coordinate D-4 on his ocean grid.

## IT'S A MISS!
If you call out a shot location not occupied by a ship on your opponent's ocean grid, it's a miss. Record your miss by placing a white peg in the corresponding target hole on your target grid so you won't call this shot again. It's not necessary for players to mark each other's misses with white pegs on their ocean grids.

After a hit or a miss, your turn is over.

**Example:** Now it's Alex's turn.
Alex calls: "F-4."
You answer: "Miss."

Alex places a white peg in coordinate F-4 of his target grid.

Play continues in this manner, with you and your opponent calling one shot per turn.

---

# SINKING A SHIP
Once all the holes in any one ship are filled with red pegs, it has been sunk. The owner of the ship must announce which ship was sunk. Keep track of how many of your opponent's ships you sink by placing a red peg for each ship sunk in one of the five holes at the top of your game unit (see Figure 7).

## DECLARING A WORD
When your turn begins, you may declare a word. The word DOES NOT have all letters guessed before declaringWhen you have sunk all the holes in a ship, you may declare the word that ship represents. You must declare the word before your next turn begins. If you declare the correct word, you sink that ship and earn an extra turn. If you declare an incorrect word, your turn ends immediately and you lose your next turn.

## WINNING THE GAME
If you're the first player to sink your opponent's entire fleet of 5 ships, you win the game!
