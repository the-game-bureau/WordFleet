## HOW TO PLAY

Captains alternate turns attacking each other's fleets.

### YOUR TURN
On your turn, you must **call out a letter** and may **declare a (Word) Ship**.

#### Step 1: Call Out a Letter
Choose any letter A-Z and ask: *"Any R's in your fleet?"*

#### Step 2: Opponent Responds
Your opponent must honestly reveal:
- **Hit:** "R at A5 and C7" (all positions where that letter appears)
- **Miss:** "No R's"

#### Step 3: Record the Result
- Mark hits on your Battle Grid
- Cross off the called letter in "Mark Used Letters"
- Update "Enemy (Word) Ships" with any new information

#### Step 4: Declare a (Word) Ship (Optional)
If you think you know one of your opponent's words, declare it:
*"I think HOUSE is one of your (Word) Ships!"*

**‚úÖ Correct Declaration**
- That (Word) Ship is immediately destroyed
- The exact coordinates are confirmed by the opponent
- Call another letter, but no more declarations this turn

**‚ùå Wrong Declaration**
- Your turn ends immediately
- Your opponent gets a bonus letter if their first letter was a hit
