Word Fleet
Sink or Spell
Game Overview
Word Fleet is an innovative word game combining elements of Battleship, Word Search, and Scrabble. Players secretly place words on grids and attempt to discover their opponent's words through strategic coordinate calls or letter guesses.

Components & Setup
What You Need
2 Player Grids: 10×10 grids labeled A-J (horizontal) and 1-10 (vertical)
Word Cards: Deck of cards with word lengths on back, actual words on front
Writing Materials: Pencils or dry-erase markers
Card Distribution
Each player receives exactly 5 cards:
1 two-letter word card
2 three-letter word cards
1 four-letter word card
1 five-letter word card
Setup Process
Each player receives a 10×10 grid and 5 word cards
Players look at their words and secretly write them on their grid
Words can be placed horizontally or vertically (up, down, left, right)
Words cannot overlap but may touch at edges or corners
Players keep their grids hidden from opponents

Core Game Rules
Victory Condition
First player to capture all 5 opponent words wins
Basic Turn Structure
Player makes an attack (coordinate call or letter call)
Opponent responds with required information
Attacking player may declare a word (optional)
Turn continues or ends based on result
Declaration Rules
Correct Declaration:
Capture the word
Opponent marks word as "sunk"
Take another complete turn
Wrong Declaration:
Turn ends immediately
Opponent's turn begins

Game Version 1: Coordinate Calls (Standard)
How to Play
Call Coordinate: Player calls a grid position ("B-7")
Response: Opponent responds "Hit" or "Miss"
After a Hit: Choose one option:
Call another coordinate (continue hunting)
Declare the word ("I think it's HOUSE")
After a Miss: Turn ends, opponent's turn begins
Continue: Keep going until you miss or make a declaration
Example Turn
Player calls "C-4" → "Hit"
Player calls "C-5" → "Hit"
Player calls "C-6" → "Miss"
Turn ends, opponent's turn

Game Version 2: Letter Calls (Alternate)
How to Play
Call Letter: Player calls any letter ("Is there an R?")
Response: Opponent gives ALL positions containing that letter ("R at C-4 and F-8")
Optional Declaration: After receiving positions, may declare any word
Turn End: If no declaration made, turn ends
Strategic Notes
Common letters (E, A, R, S, T) reveal more information but help opponent too
Uncommon letters (Q, X, Z, J) are safer but less informative
Players must give all positions of called letters
Example Turn
Player calls "Letter A" → "A at B-3, E-7, and H-2"
Player declares "CAT" → Incorrect
Turn ends, opponent's turn

Game Variations
Scrambled Words Variation
Advanced Version - Recommended for Experienced Players
Setup Changes:
Players write their words on the grid with letters scrambled/rearranged
Example: HOUSE might be placed as H-S-U-O-E or any other arrangement
Scrambled letters must still be placed in a straight line (horizontal or vertical)
Gameplay Changes:
When placing words, letters can be in any order along the line
BOOK could become K-O-O-B or O-B-K-O, etc.
All letters of a word must still be consecutive and in a straight line
Declarations must be the correct unscrambled word
Creates an additional puzzle layer - first unscramble, then declare
Strategy Impact:
Adds significant complexity as opponents must unscramble before declaring
Players must solve anagrams in addition to finding letter positions
Increases game difficulty and thinking time substantially
Theme Decks
Create specialized word sets: Animals, Colors, Food, Science, etc.
All words in a game come from the same theme
Adds educational value and strategic depth
Timed Turns
60-second maximum per turn to prevent analysis paralysis
Keeps game moving at engaging pace

Strategy Guide
Placement Strategy
Clustering: Group short words together to confuse opponent
Spreading: Distribute words across grid to avoid detection patterns
Corner Protection: Place words in corners for defensive advantage
Edge Play: Use grid edges to limit opponent's search angles
Hunting Strategy
Systematic Search: Grid-by-grid methodical approach
Pattern Recognition: Look for common word beginnings/endings
Risk Assessment: Balance early declarations vs. gathering more information
Letter Frequency: In letter version, start with common letters for maximum information

Legal Considerations
Battleship Trademark Analysis
Hasbro Inc. owns the "BATTLESHIP" trademark, which they registered in 1967. However, the situation is more nuanced than simple ownership:
What Hasbro Owns vs. What's Public Domain
Hasbro's Trademark Protection:
The name "BATTLESHIP" is a registered trademark for "apparatus sold as a unit for playing a board game having movable pieces"
Milton Bradley (now owned by Hasbro) introduced the plastic pegboard version in 1967
The specific trade dress (visual appearance, colors, packaging)
What's in the Public Domain:
The core gameplay mechanics - "Battleship" has been around since before World War I as a pencil-and-paper game
The basic concept dates back to French game "L'Attaque" during WWI, and similar games like E.I. Horsman's 1890 "Basilinda"
Game rules themselves cannot be copyrighted
What This Means for Word Fleet
Good news for your game!
The gameplay mechanics are fair game - you can use the basic coordinate-calling, grid-based mechanics without any legal issues. You just need to avoid:
Using the name "Battleship"
Copying Hasbro's specific visual design elements
Using their trademarked ship names or exact board layout
Your Word Fleet is completely safe because:
You're using a different name
Your mechanics combine multiple game elements (Battleship + word games)
You're placing words instead of ships
The core grid-based guessing mechanic is public domain
So you can freely develop and publish Word Fleet without any concerns about Hasbro's Battleship trademark!

Word Fleet combines the tactical excitement of Battleship with the intellectual challenge of word games, creating a unique and engaging experience for players of all skill levels.
