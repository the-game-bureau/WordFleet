# ‚öì Rules of Engagement

Word Fleet combines the strategy of Battleship with the word-building challenge of Wordle. Deploy your fleet of words across the battlefield and sink your opponent's ships by launching precise letter strikes!

## üì° Hailing the Enemy

*Who strikes first? Use your launch codes and cunning to negotiate who fires the opening round!*

**OPENING GAMBIT** ‚Äî One captain (the Initiator) calls out a real or fake launch code.

**RESPONSE** ‚Äî The other captain (the Defender) has three choices:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**CONCEDE** ‚Äî The Initiator goes first.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**CHALLENGE** ‚Äî If it was a real code, the Initiator goes first. If not, the Defender goes first.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**COUNTER** ‚Äî The Defender calls out a higher launch code (real or fake) and becomes the new Initiator.

**RESOLUTION** ‚Äî The process repeats until someone concedes or challenges.

## ‚öì Fleet Deployment

### Ship Types
Deploy 5 Word Ships of specific lengths:
- **KETCH:** 5-letter word (example: STORM)
- **SHIP:** 4-letter word (example: WAVE)
- **SUB:** 3-letter word (example: FOG)
- **ARK:** 3-letter word (example: SEA)
- **PT:** 2-letter word (example: GO)

### Placement Rules
- Each Word Ship must be a valid English word
- Place ships horizontally (left to right) or vertically (top to bottom)
- Word Ships cannot overlap, but may touch at edges
- No proper nouns, abbreviations, prefixes, suffixes, or words requiring a hyphen/apostrophe
- Keep your Defense Grid hidden from your opponent

### Grid Setup
Your Defense Grid is 10√ó10, labeled A‚ÄìJ horizontally and 1‚Äì10 vertically. Place your fleet of 5 Word Ships by writing one letter per coordinate.

### Classified Manifest
After placing your Word Ships, count how many times each letter appears in your fleet. Fill in these counts in the Classified Manifest section of your Battle Tracker. This helps you quickly answer Letter Sweeps and is required for gameplay.

## üéØ Combat Phase

### Choose Your Move
On your turn, choose ONE of the following actions:

#### Letter Sweep
Ask about a letter's frequency in the enemy fleet
- Name any letter of the alphabet
- Opponent reveals total count in their fleet
- Each letter can only be asked ONCE per game
- Mark the count in your Recon Log









#### Coordinate Attack
Call out a grid coordinate AND a letter

**Example:** E9-T

**Miss** ‚Äî There is no letter in that location. (No letter information revealed.)

**Bullseye (Green)** ‚Äî That is a correct location and that is the correct letter.

**Hit & Yes** ‚Äî There is a different letter in that location. Called letter IS in the fleet.

**Hit & No** ‚Äî There is a different letter in that location. Called letter IS NOT in the fleet.








### Example Turns:
- Letter Sweep: "How many R's are in your fleet?" Opponent: "I have 2 R's."
- Coordinate Attack: "B4 - T" Opponent: "Hit" (there's a Word Ship at B4, but it's not a T)

### Silent Service
When answering Letter Sweeps, don't reveal which Word Ships contain the letter‚Äîonly the total count.

## üìä Your Battle Station Layout

### Attack Grid (Top Left)
Use this grid to track all Coordinate Attacks on your opponent:
- Mark bullseyes with the correct letter in a circle
- Mark hits with an X and note which letter you guessed
- Mark misses with dots
- Draw lines through confirmed sunken Word Ships when all letters are found

### Recon Log (Top Right)
Track your Letter Sweeps systematically:
- Circle letters that exist in opponent's fleet
- Cross out letters with zero count
- Write the exact count next to each letter asked about
- Vowels are highlighted as high-priority targets

## üèÜ Victory Conditions
The first commander to sink all five enemy Word Ships wins the battle!

Word Ships sink when all their letters are correctly identified through Coordinate Attacks. Track your progress and deduce the enemy words from the pattern of bullseyes!

## ‚öîÔ∏è Advanced Tactics
Master tacticians use common word patterns, letter frequency, and strategic placement to outmaneuver their opponent. Every letter matters in this battle of wits and words!

## üé≤ Optional Rules

### Themed Fleets
Both commanders must use words from agreed categories (animals, colors, military terms, etc.).

### Minefield
Each commander places 1 mine on their Defense Grid. If the opponent hits it, the defending commander immediately gets two full turns in a row. The mine is revealed when struck.

## üìã Battle Planning

### Requisition the Following
- One Battle Tracker sheet for each commander (print from thegamebureau.com/wrdflt)
- 2 pens or pencils
- Optional: highlighters

### Word Selection
Before starting, agree with your opponent on one method:
- **Auto-Generated Words:** Use the pre-selected words printed on your Battle Tracker
- **Choose Your Own:** Select your own words following the Word Ship size requirements

Both commanders must use the same method‚Äîno mixing allowed!

### Reading Your Launch Codes
Your Battle Tracker displays 5 three-digit launch codes (like 142, 087, 953). These codes determine turn order through the bidding system described in "Hailing the Enemy."

## üéñÔ∏è Final Briefing

### Turn Summary
1. Choose: Letter Sweep OR Coordinate Attack
2. Record all information on your Battle Tracker
3. Pass turn to your opponent

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Asking about the same letter twice
- Forgetting to track letter counts
- Not recording whether attacks were bullseyes, hits, or misses
- Placing Word Ships diagonally (not allowed)

## üé® Optional: Color Coding System

For enhanced visual tracking, some players use a color system inspired by word games:

- **Green Letters:** Confirmed bullseyes (correct letter in correct position)
- **Yellow Letters:** Letters confirmed to be in the enemy fleet but not yet located
- **Gray Letters:** Letters confirmed NOT in the enemy fleet (zero count from Letter Sweeps)

This system helps quickly identify which letters to prioritize in future attacks and which areas of the grid to focus on.

## Game Synopsis

**Word Fleet** is a strategic word game that combines Battleship with Wordle mechanics. Two players secretly deploy fleets of five word ships (lengths 5, 4, 3, 3, and 2 letters) on 10x10 grids, then take turns trying to sink each other's ships.

**Setup:** Players first engage in "Hailing the Enemy" - a bluffing mini-game using launch codes to determine who goes first. Then each captain places their word ships (valid English words) horizontally or vertically on their hidden grid.

**Combat:** On each turn, players choose between two attack types:
- **Letter Sweep:** Ask "How many R's are in your fleet?" to gather intelligence
- **Coordinate Attack:** Target a specific location with a letter guess, like "B4 - T"

Attacks result in **Miss** (empty water), **Hit** (ship present, wrong letter), or **Bullseye** (correct letter). Players track results on their battle tracker, using deduction to identify enemy words.

**Victory:** The first captain to sink all enemy ships wins. Ships sink when every letter is correctly identified through coordinate attacks.

The game rewards strategic thinking, word knowledge, and tactical deduction - every letter sweep and attack provides clues to help solve your opponent's hidden word fleet.
